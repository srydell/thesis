This thesis is the result of 8 months of work between April and November 2018 for the degree of Master of Science in Engineering Physics. The work was written under the supervision of Prof. Mats Wallin at the Theoretical Physics department at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. All large scale simulations in this thesis were run on the Octopus cluster belonging to the physics department at KTH.
